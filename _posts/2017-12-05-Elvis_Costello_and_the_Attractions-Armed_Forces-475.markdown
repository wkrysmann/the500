### Elvis Costello and the Attractions - Armed Forces
Big name, big music.

I was really surprised after listening to this album. I thought that I don't know Elvis Costello's music, but I was wrong, really wrong. Most of the tunes are well known anthems, which all of us heard thousand times. Besides of that, I was not bored at all and it gave me a lot of good energy for the day.
