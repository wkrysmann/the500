### The Notorious B.I.G - Life After Death
R.A.P.

I was not able to finish this album, I'm really tired of RAP and I don't think that if we are choosing best of the best albums of all times there should be so many albums of that genre, but, this is only my private opinion. Anyway, this was extremely boring to listen to this.
