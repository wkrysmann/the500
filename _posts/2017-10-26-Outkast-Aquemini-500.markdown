### Outkast Aquemini
So here's the first one, no. 500 on The Rolling Stones Magazine top 500 of all time. Just after listening first two numbers I was not really convinced if this album should appear on any top list. But besides the idea of writing a blog, I also have a goal, to develop my music taste, and discover new music and styles. I've made my best to be open minded, even if Hip Hop is not my favorite style. Surprisingly, with each number Aquemini is drifting to different style, something closer to my taste. Instrumental is overtaking the classic hip-hop expression and the album is not tiring you with never ending stories. I have to admit, that it was not an easy beginning of challenge for me, but for sure this album is worth your time. My advice would be to listen it just once - from very beginning to the end, to experience the subtle transformation of Outkast during that 70 minutes.
