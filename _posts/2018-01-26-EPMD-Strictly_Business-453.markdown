### EPMD - Strictly Business
Funk and RAP.

I was imagining route 66 while I was listening to previous album of Alice Cooper. With EPMD I feel like walking down the street with old battery driven radio on my arm. If you are reading notes on this blog, you probably know that I don't enjoy HIP-HOP or so at all. However this album I found pretty nice, thanks to the flavours of Funk.
