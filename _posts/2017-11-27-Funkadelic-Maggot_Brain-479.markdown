### Funkadelic - Maggot Brain
From guitar solo to insanity.

This albums starts with 8 minute long peaceful guitar solo. But this is only a promise of incoming insanity. It sounds extremely raw, you can hear a lot of background noise, guitar effects plays only on one channel, and so on.
The tension is growing during the whole performance, to become extremely wild at the end... and than, last song will brake a little. Cool experience.
