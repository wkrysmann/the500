### What's the Rolling Stones 500 greatest albums of all time?
On 2003 Rolling Stone magazine introduced a list of 500 albums, which were chosen by musicians, critics and some other guys who should know what a "greates albums of all times" mean.
In 2012 Rolling Stone magazine revisited the list, and in this blog I'll be focusing on the revisited version. For more details please visit [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_Stone%27s_500_Greatest_Albums_of_All_Time "Wiki for 500 greatest albums of all time")

### What this blog is about?
This is my attempt to listen and rate all the albums.

`Disclaimer: I'm not a professional critic. I love music, and I'm open for every style.`

`Disclaimer 2: My listening experience is heavily dependent on my mood and it's highly probable, that some of the rates will be biased`

I'm planning to listen one album every work day, however I'm not pretty sure if I'll achieve that.

`Disclaimer 3: Not always I'll be able to listen on my main audio system, and sometimes I'll have to appeal to my headphones, which are quite decent, through, but can bias my judge`

All at all, music can't be rated equally, so please, keep in mind that this all of the posts are my personal opinions.
And by the way - thanks for reading :)
