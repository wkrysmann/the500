### Eurythmics - Touch
You can dance everywhere with this tunes.

Eurythmics is well known for being a precursor of electronic music. Sound of this early synthesizers cannot compare with anything. You have to listen to it at least once to understand how the nowadays electronic music has born. I would call this album very pure, and nasty at the same time. Cutting edge technology of that times which now remind us first video games were driving most of the discos back in the day. We have to have some respect to that stuff!
