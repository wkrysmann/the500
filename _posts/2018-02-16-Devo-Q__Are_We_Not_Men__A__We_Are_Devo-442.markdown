### Devo - Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo
I can't get no satisfaction, can I?

First of all - I'm not sure who designed a cover of this album, but it's awful. What about tunes? One can say that it's a bunch of covers from some not known band. I've listened to it without a huge excitement on any of tunes.
