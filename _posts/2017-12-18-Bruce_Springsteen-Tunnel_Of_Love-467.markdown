### Bruce Springsteen - Tunnel Of Love
Ain't got you!

First song on this album sounded very promising, even if wasn't expecting anything special from this album. But afterwards it became more what I was expecting. A little bit vague, but not completely. Some of the songs are not even worth mentioning, they are not a kind of songs which makes you increasing volume, usually you would not mention them. However there is something special in this album. It builds a special aura around you during listening, you think about all the old movies from the 70'.
