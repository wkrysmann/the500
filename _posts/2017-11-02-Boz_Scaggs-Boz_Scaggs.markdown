### Boz Scaggs - Boz Scaggs
A piece of good blues.

Boz Scaggs give you a lot of pleasure while listening to this album. Very good balance during the whole album. Besides of blues there are some different influences, which overall build a very nice experience. It's not a blues which will drive you to any kind of nostalgy, rather completely opposite you will move your mind into peaceful place.
