### The Magnetic Fields - 69 Love Songs
Love is all around :)

I usually don't like albums which are not consistent, and I don't mean that they have a consistent BPM or speed. I like when author had an idea how this album should sound - from first second to the end. I thought that selection of those songs will make a bigger sense, but instead of fact, that they are all love songs, I can say anything more.
