### MGMT - Oracular Spectacular
A lot of well known anthems.

If you are listening electronic music from time to time, you know anthems from this album for sure! From the very beginning of the album you hear a well known and reused melodies. MGMT is little bit wild, but the album is really nice to listen, after listening to it you want more. To be honest, I was continuing to listen some other tracks of them after finishing Oracular Spectacular, for sure it's worth listening.
