### The Paul Butterfield Blues Band - The Paul Butterfield Blues Band
Great piece of blues.

If you are a fan of blues, you know every note of this album, for sure. I rather prefer Jazz, because this specific harmony of blues is not necessarily putting me into right mood, however this album is slightly different. It have a lot of positive vibes and energy. I'm usually listening albums in two parts - first, during my commute to work, and second part during my way back. Such technic ensures that even if I'm not in right mood on morning, there's a big chance that it will change during my way back. I think that it makes the whole rating more objective. Why I'm actually referring to this? Because this album sounded great in the morning and in the evening! No matter what mood you have, this album will make it only better, never worst.
