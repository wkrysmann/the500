### Coldplay - A Rush of Blood to the Head
Rush of blood to the head?

I'm not saying this very often, but I love the cover of this album. When I'm looking at it, it's very promising. What about actual content? It's very expressive, but easy to listen at one time. For sure you want to sing when you listening to it. I have to admit - it's a great album, with lots and lots of well known top hits.
