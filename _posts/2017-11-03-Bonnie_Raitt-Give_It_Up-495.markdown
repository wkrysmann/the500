### Bonnie Raitt - Give It Up (Remastered Version)
Album cover is so awful, that I incorrectly judged this album before listening!

When I prepared this album a day before listening, my first thought was that it will be really bad, I couldn't be more wrong! This is really good album. Bonnie's voice is pretty charming, and music makes you feel like dancing.
