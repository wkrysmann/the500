### B.B. King - Live in Cook County Jail
Very short album, which you absolutely want to listen again, right after it ends.

B.B King will not let you stop for a second. During the whole album you are entertained either by King's voice or by the band playing. There is no single second of silence, but in opposite of what you can expect by this description it's not tiring at all. I would even say that it's easy to listen. Artists walk you through they journey making your experience deeper and deeper. You can hear that they exactly know how to build atmosphere during the whole performance, King is relaxed and absolutely charming, he even send kisses from the stage. The only downside of the whole album is that it's very short, I was pretty sure, that they took a break in the middle of the concert, but they suddenly finished the performance. I was surprised by the quality of the recording - in the end it has 46 years!
