### Steve Miller Band - Fly Like an Eagle
A collage.

A weird mix of styles and moods, this is Fly Like an Eagle. For me, title would suggest that I should expect some kind of folk or country. But this is not true. Intro, called "Space intro" brakes this assumption immediately. And than Fly Like an Eagle - again, fusion of styles, Hammond organs, but also a flavour of synthesisers. I really appreciate such surprises!
