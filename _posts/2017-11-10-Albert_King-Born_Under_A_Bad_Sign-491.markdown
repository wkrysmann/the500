### Albert King - Born Under A Bad Sign
Solid peace of Blues.

This album is very bluesy, however you can find drifts to other styles, like Rock, Jazz and even Rock and Roll. I would not call it best album I ever heard, but it's really enjoyable. If you are not very familiar with blues, this is a good start. It's not too engaging - I mean, not to hard to listen, so it's really good start.
