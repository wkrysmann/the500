### Mott the Hoople - All the Young Dudes
Jerkin' Cronus?!

Piece of easy to listen, good sounding album. This is again one of the albums that is really enjoyable to listen. There is a lot of good guitar riffs and vocals. I was listening to it during my train trip, and I enjoyed a lot to watch tries running out outside the window with those tunes.
