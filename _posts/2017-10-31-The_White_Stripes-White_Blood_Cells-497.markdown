### The White Stripes - White Blood Cells
Powerful, yet easy to listen.

This album have a lot of power, but it's also not disturbing at all. I would say that it is well balanced, have a kick when it's needed and gentle from time to time. It will walk you through the short journey of various climates. From my experience it's really unusual that none of the album songs is begging to skip it. It was a lot of pleasure to listen this album, however I will not get back to it soon.
