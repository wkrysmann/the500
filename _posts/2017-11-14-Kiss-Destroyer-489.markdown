### Kiss - Destroyer
Surprisingly easy to listen.

I was pretty sure that this album will be really hard to listen, but it's not true. There are obviously a lot of strong blows, but there's also place to get a breath. I'll not become a huge fan of Kiss after that, but it's still worth trying, and know that such kind of variety of music.
