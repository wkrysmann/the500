### Cheap Trick - In Color
Oh Caroline!

Classic, good old Rock. I like it. Listening to this list more and more, I have a question in mind - if I would make a same selection of albums. Probably no, as there is a lot of albums which are not in my taste, like this one. Great think, however is a fact that I'm discovering a lot of albums. Even if this album is not completely in my taste tunes like "oh caroline" make me dance ;)
