### Pearl Jam - Vitalogy
I had to listen 16 albums to find a mind blower.

Short disclaimer - I was listening to Remastered version and I think it have a lot to do with overall impression of this album. I think that quality is extremely important to have a right impression on music. Pearl Jam requires high level of volume and good quality to understand the potential of this album. There is a lot of stuff going on during this 70 minutes. For me, Vitalogy is the best one so far, during my journey through 500 best albums ever made.
