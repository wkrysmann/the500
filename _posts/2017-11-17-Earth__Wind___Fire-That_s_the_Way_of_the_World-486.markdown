### Earth, Wind & Fire - That's the Way of the World
Piece of great music, which passed without notice.

I'm writing this post a day after listening to this album, and for some reason i Can't recon a single piece of this album. So this time I'll be speaking only on my feeling from yesterday, while I was listening. It was a lot of pleasure coming with this tunes, I was shaking my head during listening. There was a lot of jazzy moments. I can't figure out why I am not able to recon any particular tune - maybe I was thinking about some different stuff, or had a worst day.
