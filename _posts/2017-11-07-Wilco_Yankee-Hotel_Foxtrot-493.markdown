### Wilco Yankee - Hotel Foxtrot
Have a specific athmosphere, but not blowing your mind.

There are some bits and pieces on this album which you really love, first song is really charming. I really like to listen album from beginning to the end and feel that someone picked songs which build certain atmosphere while listening. This is one of the albums which is really well balanced, and the last song is a cherry on top, it's closing the album really well. I don't enjoyed that much everything in the middle. Please don't get me wrong - this is a nice album, but not outstanding.
