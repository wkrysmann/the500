### Echo And The Bunnymen - Heaven Up Here
London?

I was wondering if this band is from UK. Yes, it is. You can hear this specific rainy aura from the first sounds to the end of the album. This identity is deep there. It was really nice experience to listen to it. Album cover was not suggesting anything like that.
