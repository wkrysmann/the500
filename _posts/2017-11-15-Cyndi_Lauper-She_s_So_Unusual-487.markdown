### Cyndi Lauper - She's So Unusual
It is not very unusal.

This album is really a flagship contributor to it's times. It is very "sweet", and today it brings a smile to listener. After all that pop songs being written during last three decades, it sounds a little bit silly, but still - it's a precursor of todays pop and we should appreciate that.
