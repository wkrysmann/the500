### Dire Straits - Brothers in Arms
A lot of pleasure on small circle.

I'm staying in my friends flat, as we are visitin Audio Video Show in Warsaw. I just found a Dire Straits Japanese Remastered version on his collection. I couldn't resist, he have quite decent audio system, so we had a persfect situation to rest after a long day. But lets get to the point. Every one knows this album, however most popular songs are not the ones you should focus on. There are some pearls which I couldn't recon but are really great. This album have to have it's place on music history of man kind. 

It's 17th of November 2017 today, but I will release this post on apropriate schedule.
